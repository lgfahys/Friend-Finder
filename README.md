## How It Works

Users will begin by entering their name and adding a photo of themselves. They will then complete a 10 question survey where they will rate how much they agree/disagree with statements on a scale of 1-5. Using compatability logic created in JavaScript, the most compatible match stored in the 'Friends API' will be returned to the user. The users survey results will then be stored in the 'Friends API' so other users can match with them!
